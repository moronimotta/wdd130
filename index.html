            <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Hello, my name is Moroni Motta">
    
            <p>My name is Moroni Arthur Motta, and I was born on June 21, 2001. I am a member of The Church of Jesus
                Christ of Latter-day Saints. I grew up in the covenant and, as a result, developed a strong interest in
                learning more about religion.</p>
    
            <p>In 2020, I decided to dedicate two years of my life to serve as a full-time missionary in São Paulo East and
                Uganda, sharing my faith and helping people come closer to Christ.</p>
    
            <p>When I returned, I started working as a Full-Stack programmer, which allows me to combine my passion for
                technology with the need for financial support. I was also called to serve as Second Counselor in the Elders
                Quorum and as an Institute teacher, where I can use my leadership and counseling skills to help others in my
                community.</p>
    
            <p>Outside of work and church activities, I have several hobbies. I enjoy drawing and voice acting, which allow
                me to express my creativity in different ways from my daily routine. Additionally, I continue to study and
                learn more about Jewish culture and the Christian religion, always seeking to expand my knowledge and
                understanding of these important topics.</p>

            <h2>Santa Catarina, Brazil</h2>
            <img src="https://blog.123milhas.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/conheca-estado-santa-catarina-litoral-balneario-camboriu-conexao123.jpg"

            <p>Santa Catarina is a state located in the southern region of Brazil. It has numerous beaches and mountainous
                tourist spots. The majority of the population born in the state are descendants of Italians and Germans, and
                in some older locations, these languages are still spoken.</p>
            <p>The capital of the state is Florianopolis, with its beautiful beaches and incredible cultural heritage.
                Despite being the capital, it is not the city with the highest population.</p>
            <p>The state is also famous for its natural beauty in the interior, such as the Serra Catarinense, with its
                mountain landscapes, valleys, and waterfalls, and the Vale Europeu region, with its charming cities and
                European colonization.</p>
            <p>The economy of Santa Catarina is diversified, with a focus on the textile, ceramic, automotive,
                metallurgical, and tourism industries. The state is known for its strong industrial base and
                entrepreneurship, being one of the most developed states in Brazil.</p>
            <p>In Joinville, my hometown, the first member of the Church in Brazil was baptized in 1929, and the Church was
                first organized on October 25, 1931. The chapel still exists today (it's my ward).</p>
