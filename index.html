        <p>My name is Moroni Arthur Motta, and I was born on June 21, 2001. I am a member of The Church of Jesus
            Christ of Latter-day Saints. I grew up in the covenant and, as a result, developed a strong interest in
            learning more about religion.</p>

        <p>In 2020, I decided to dedicate two years of my life to serve as a full-time missionary in SÃ£o Paulo East and
            Uganda, sharing my faith and helping people come closer to Christ.</p>

        <p>When I returned, I started working as a Full-Stack programmer, which allows me to combine my passion for
            technology with the need for financial support. I was also called to serve as Second Counselor in the Elders
            Quorum and as an Institute teacher, where I can use my leadership and counseling skills to help others in my
            community.</p>

        <p>Outside of work and church activities, I have several hobbies. I enjoy drawing and voice acting, which allow
            me to express my creativity in different ways from my daily routine. Additionally, I continue to study and
            learn more about Jewish culture and the Christian religion, always seeking to expand my knowledge and
            understanding of these important topics.</p>
